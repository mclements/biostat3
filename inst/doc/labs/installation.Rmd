Installation for Biostatistics III in R
======================================================

R will be used throughout the course. This section describes how to
download and install the files required for the computing exercises
(e.g., data files) as well as how to install packages for
extending R. If you are working in a computer lab during a course
itâ€™s possible these files may have already been installed for you.

Downloading the course files
----------------------------

It is suggested that you create a new directory, change the R
working directory to the new directory (e.g., `setwd("c:\survival\")`), and
then download the files. You can create a new directory in Windows
Explorer or another file manager.

Use the `getwd()` function to confirm that you are in the working directory you
wish to use for the course. The course files are available on the web as
a ZIP archive:\
<http://biostat3.net/download/biostat3.zip>\
Save and extract this folder in your created working directory. You can
also read the data files directly from the web from within R. For
example,

    library(foreign)
	colon <- read.dta("http://www.biostat3.net/download/colon.dta")

Installing R packages 
--------------------------------------

Download and installation of R packages is generally done within R.

### How can I check if these commands are already installed?

You can use the `library` function to check if an R package is installed (and load it).

    library(biostat3)  # main package (not yet on CRAN)
    library(car)       # linearHypothesis()
    library(muhaz)     # muhaz()
	## some additional packages
    library(rstpm2)    # stpm2(), pstpm2()
    library(bshazard)  # bshazard()
    library(Epi)       # ccwc()
    library(dplyr)     # mutate(), filter(), group_by(), summarise(), %>%

If any of these libraries are not available, then they can be installed by

	## CRAN dependencies
    install.packages(c("muhaz","car"))
	## NB: car requires R>=3.2.3
    install.packages(c("bshazard","rstpm2","Epi","dplyr"))
	
    ## Windows
	install.packages("http://biostat3.net/download/biostat3.zip",repos=NULL)
	## Linux, Mac
	install.packages("http://biostat3.net/download/biostat3.tar.gz",repos=NULL)
